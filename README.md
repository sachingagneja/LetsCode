# LetsCode

A full-stack web application that provides a platform for users to solve coding questions, contribute new ones, and engage in a community chat. The application ensures a moderated environment with a profanity filter and includes features for both users and administrators.

## Features

### User Features
- **Solve Coding Questions:** Users can solve coding challenges added by the admin. (Currently supports C++ only.)
- **Contribute Questions:** Users can submit new coding problems for admin approval.
- **Query Resolution:** Users can ask queries related to coding challenges, which are addressed by the admin.
- **Community Chat:** A real-time chat feature for community interaction, equipped with a profanity filter.

### Admin Features
- **Add Challenges:** Admins can add coding problems for users to solve.
- **Approve Submissions:** Admins review and approve questions contributed by users.
- **Query Resolution:** Admins resolve user queries submitted through the platform.
- **User Moderation:** Admins are notified if a user uses profanity in the community chat. After three reports, the user's account is deleted.

### Community Moderation
- **Profanity Filter:** Messages with swear words are flagged, and the user is reported.
- **User Account Deletion:** Accounts are deleted after three profanity reports to ensure a safe and respectful environment.
